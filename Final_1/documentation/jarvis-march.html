      <h2>Algorithm Description</h2>
      <p>The Jarvis March algorithm, also known as the Gift Wrapping algorithm, is a simple and efficient algorithm for
        finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane. It works by iteratively wrapping the points with a
        convex polygon, starting from the leftmost point and moving in a counterclockwise direction.</p>

        Define constructor with parameters x, y
          Initialize this.x with x
          Initialize this.y with y
        
        Define an empty array named points

            For each point in points starting from the second
              If point is the same as current, continue
              Calculate val using crossProduct(current, nextTarget, point)
              If val > 0
                Update nextTarget to this point
                Reset collinearPoints
              Else if val == 0
                If distance(current, nextTarget, point) < 0

      <h2>Complexity Analysis</h2>

      <h3><strong>Case 1: n is increasing and h is constant</strong></h3>
    <p>
        As the total number of points (n) increases, but the number of points that make up the hull (h) remains constant, the complexity behaves linearly with respect to n.
        <br><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(nh) ~ O(n), since h is constant.
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Case 2: h increases with n</strong></h3>
    <p>
        When h increases proportionally with n, leading up to the worst-case scenario where h equals n, we observe a quadratic increase in complexity.
        <br><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(nh) ~ O(n^2) (Quadratic function).
    </p>

    <h3><strong>Case 3: h increases slower than n</strong></h3>
    <p>
        If h increases at a rate slower than n, such as logarithmically, the complexity finds a middle ground, better than the worst case but not as good as the best case.
        <br><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Better than O(n^2) but worse than O(n), often O(n log n) or O(nâˆšh) depending on h's specific growth rate and distribution.
    </p>
